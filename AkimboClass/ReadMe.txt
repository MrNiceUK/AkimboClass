Outstanding issues:

Visualization problems with dual shot (and overwatch that uses dual shot vis) - sometimes damage is dealt before animation plays out

Dual Shot and Unload don't end turn

Stat progression with promotions (at least for aim) doesn't work

Idle pose is bad?

AddExcludeEffect(effect) -> targets with this effect will not be considered viable (will be excluded)
